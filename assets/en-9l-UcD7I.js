I explore the intersections of artificial intelligence, creative practice, and philosophical theory through a multidisciplinary approach that spans computer science, epistemology, and the historical dynamics of technology in society.",research_intro:"My research unfolds across three primary branches:",research_1_title:"1. Computational Creativity & AI Tools",research_1_desc:"I design intelligent systems to assist and stimulate creativity within the artistic community—including musicians, sound designers, and game developers. These tools are informed by both rule-based and data-driven methods, with applications in audio, interaction, and generative media.",research_2_title:"2. Epistemology of Creativity & Human Action",research_2_desc:"I conduct theoretical research on the nature of creativity and human action, and how these fundamentally differ from—or align with—artificial intelligence. This includes inquiries into epistemology, logic, and Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems as a foundation for understanding the limits of formal and algorithmic systems. This perspective informs the design of tools that aim not to replicate creativity, but to better stimulate and extend human creative potential.",research_3_title:"3. Philosophy, Economics, and Technology in Society",research_3_desc:"I conduct interdisciplinary research in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethics, while also drawing from economic history and the cultural evolution of technology to analyze how ideas shape tools—and vice versa.",thesis_desc:"During my graduate studies at the University of Michigan, I collaborated with faculty and fellows across the Departments of Robotics, Performing Arts Technology, Psychology, and the School of Art & Design. My master's thesis—advised by Hao-Wen Dong, John Granzow, and Patrícia Alves-Oliveira—investigated the design and evaluation of intelligent creative tools built on contrasting paradigms: axiomatic, rule-based systems versus purely data-driven models, and how we might design effective hybrid systems grounded in a deeper understanding of human creative action. The work combined technical development with a critical theoretical component, exploring not only how AI can assist human creativity, but also how excessive reliance on data-driven methods may ultimately distort our conception of creativity itself. This foundational inquiry continues to shape the next phase of my research.",artistic_practice:"In addition to research, I am a composer, sound artist, and game designer, with a focus on systems-based creativity and computational approaches to artistic expression."},i={title:"Education",umich:{institution:"University of Michigan",location:"Ann Arbor, MI",date:"May 2025",degree:"M.A. in Media Arts & Technology",advisor:"Advisor:"},azad:{institution:"Azad University, Central Tehran Branch",location:"Tehran, Iran",date:"February 2022",degree:"B.S. in Audio Technology",advisor:"Advisor: Reza Sabooni"}},o={title:"Professional Experience",robotics:{department:"Robot Studio, Department of Robotics",location:"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI",role:"Researcher",dates:["May 2025-present","May 2024-August 2024"]},pat:{department:"Department of Performing Arts Technology",location:"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI",role:"Graduate Research Assistant",date:"September 2023-May 2025"},stamps:{department:"Penny W.
